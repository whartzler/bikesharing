# Bikesharing

## Overview
To convice investors that a bike sharing program in Des Moines Iowa can be successful we analyzed data for the investors.  Utilized visualizations in Tableau and python for ETL.  

## Results
Please review the tableau dashboard (link below) as there details & results for each visualization. 

## Summary
Based on the data we can conclude that Manhattan is an excellent place to have a bike renting service.   Men being our largest customers traveling in the morning and evening is our most busy time.  

On this analysis we didnt review any data within Des Moines,  to truly see if this would be a great business we would need to do some analysis on specifically Des Moines to see if this is a good business idea.  

### Additional Analysis Proposals
1. Comparing the population Density of Manhattan vs Des Moines
In manhattan since its very dense in population and you cant drive as easily when compared to Des Moines we could compare to see based on population density if Des Moines is a good city to open on the CityBike Program.

2. Price Inflations during Busytimes
We could compare prices of when to rent the bikes in Manhattan.  Since there are clear times when the citibikes are primarily used to make sure profits are maximized completeing a comaprison increased prices and how many people continue to use the program.
